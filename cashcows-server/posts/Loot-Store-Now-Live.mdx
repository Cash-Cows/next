Welcome to Rodeo Drive❗ The shopping district where you can buy loot 
that will be forever attached to your cows *(soulbound)*. Loot is designed 
to increase the value of your cow and will have a purpose when the 
community reaches Boardwalk.

 - Loot can be purchased with either DOLLA or ETH where available.
 - Loot is soulbound to cows and each cow cannot have more than 1 of the same item.
 - When you sell your cow all the loot soul bound to that cow will also be transfered to the new owner.
 - Some loots are limited supply and some are unique.

> 🚨 Warning 🚨
> When you sell your cow, the loot is also automatically transferred to the new owner.

## 🛍️ Crew Discounts 🛍️

You will find that some of your cows will have special discounts 
depending on which crew they are in.
