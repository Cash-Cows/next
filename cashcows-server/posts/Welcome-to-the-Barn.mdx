This marks the next step in the journey of your Cash Cows. The end of 
this part of the experiment will be a study on how you prioritize 
intrinsic value over speculative. Let's make this a good study.

## What is the Barn?

The barn is where you can go to milk your cows.

## What do I have to do to get $MILK?

No staking, just redeem when you want it in your wallet. We provided a 
video in this post to show you how.

## How much $MILK does a cow yeild?

A cow yields 4-60 $MILK/day/cow *(according to google)*. Amounts depends 
on what Crew you are in.

## Can $MILK amounts change?

$MILK amounts per crew *(or trait!)* can be changed at anytime through 
a DAO quorum.

## How to batch redeem $MILK from many cows?

We do have provisions on the contract to batch redeem $MILK from many 
cows in one go. We decided to go for this one to get people used the 
game as it progresses. We will schedule batch milking at a later date 
for sure.
