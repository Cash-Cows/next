Cash Cows is a degen collection with over 14 utilities included. 
Here's what you need to know right now.

## #1 How do rewards work?

![cash cows club utility](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3e7luVUAA4RDq?format=jpg&name=medium)

When a cow is sold, a 10% creators fee is deducted from the sale. This 
fee is sent to a smart contract and allocated evenly to every Cow holder. 
You can redeem rewards on our website/contract.

## #2 Be careful listing your cow!

If a cow is sold, the new owner will have the rights to its unclaimed 
rewards. If you're going to sell it, list it high so you won't be a sad 
cowboy later.

## #3 Rarity isn't everything!

When buying a cow during mint, buy a cow that hasn't been purchased yet. 
‚ÑπÔ∏è Untraded cows most likely have unclaimed rewards.

## #4 ZERO listing gas fees.

## #5 E-cow-nomics

Low Volume + Low Floor Price = Listed Cows Buying Cows = Volume = Cows Happy üòÄ
When in doubt, remember... "it's a free mint"

## #6 Fair Play

The team earns by holding cows like everyone else. When we win, we all 
win. üéâ That's what we mean by sharing the wealth. üí∞

## #7 Some cows need your help.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you get one of these poor bovines, you can nurse it back to health 
and up its rarity along the way. ‚ú®

## #8 Volume = Rewards

![rewards based on sales volume](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3gmn4UYAAshVr?format=jpg&name=medium)

Rewards are sales volume-driven regardless of floor price. 
üìà High volume = High rewards. üö® Volume milestones unlock new 
experiences in the project.

## #9 Burning Cows

When you burn a cow you will get steak and a milk bonus. You need 4 
steaks to free mint into the new collection. When cows are burnt, the 
rewards for everyone else increases.

## #10 What are Crews
